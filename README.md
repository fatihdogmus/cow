This is a course management system written with NestJS on back-end and react and Next.js on front-end.

It uses best practices like hexagonal architecture, good OOP practices, clean code etc.

To get the project running, run `docker-compose up -d` to get redis and PostgreSQL up and running, then to run back-end,
run `yarn start` and for front-end run `yarn start:fe`
